Simple Instagram PHP
=============

This Readme consists the instructions required to get your Instagram's recent photos easily.

The script works by checking for the existence of "parameters.php" whose contents and purpose is described in this document.


Installation
-----------

Simply upload all 3 PHP files to desired directory, and visit that directory.


Files Included
-----

This script assumes you know how to register an Instagram client.

Further instructions are provided upon running the script.

### Setup.php

Loaded upon not detecting a parameters php file, in which this will take you through the necessary steps to easily get your Instagram feed going on your site.

### Instagram.php

This is where the magic of getting your Instagram feed happens.

### Index.php

Determines which of the two PHP files are used, depending on the existence of a parameters PHP file.

### Parameters.php

This file contains only the credentials to authorize API requests to Instagram


Contributing
------------

Feel free to fork and contribute, I'd love to see improvements to my script.

License
------------

I've chosen no specific license. This is not a super complex script. It merely takes all of the troubles I was having in obtaining information such as the access token, and puts it in a simple "setup wizard" fashion.

All I ask is that if using/distributing my script, keep my name somewhere there, and give credit when due.

Other than that, feel free to do whatever you'd like to this script.

Please do note that Instagram has their own terms of use for their API:
